This is because of initialized git repository in your frontend folder, git is considering it as a submodule. solution :

step 1. Delete .git folder manually present in your frontend folder.
step 2. type "git rm --cached YourFrontendFolderName" in cmd
step 3. type "git add YourFrontendFolderName" in cmd
step 4. type "git push " in cmd
Note : you can also write commit message after git add and all commands are written in main folder where both frontend and backend are located.
I got same error today and this worked for me. You can upvote if worked for you.
